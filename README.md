# LA-Paper
This repository contains the paper written for the mini-project of course Linear Algebra and its Applications (UE18CS203).<br>
The topic of our project was: <b><u>Introduction to Markov Chains</b></u>.

<br>

Markov Chains are mathematical systems that experience transitions from one state to
another according to certain probabilistic rules. A Markov chain is a stochastic process, but it
differs from a general stochastic process in that a Markov chain must be “memory-less.” In
other words, the probability of transitioning to any particular state is dependent solely on the
current state, and time elapsed. This is called the Markov property. Markov Chains are a
fairly common, and relatively simple way to statistically model random processes.
The aim and scope of the project report is to provide a brief introduction to Markov Chains
and also to present examples of different applications of the same within the financial and
political world.
